ISSUES
where it finds a position that was already analysed and does not see that if it is the third time it is actually reached, then it's a draw.
Maybe with a different replacing scheme also accounting for age of the entries this is solved. http://www.open-aurec.com/wbforum/viewtopic.php?t=51447
I hope solving these makes iterative deepening work well, because it is really fast.
So to sum up 2 problem hypotheses: non-detection of draw by threefold repetition and key collisions of type 1 (same hash)
Also, the second problem does not appear if the best move picked from the table is not searched first. Look more into this.
