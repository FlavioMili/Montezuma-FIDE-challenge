ISSUES

TODO

- Output correct info
- Manage move time
- Implement multithreading to always have good communicaiton and exploit pondering (= thinking in opponent's time)


- Implement hasTables
- Implement quiescence search
- Add support for opening book
- Write a better eval function?



SOLVED ISSUES
- Very rarely it still happens that the engine sees a mate but can't play it correctly and draws by repetition. Hypothesis:
	* As long as he sees a mate, the engine plays the first one it sees, even if it is longer than the shortest one.
	* It does not account for draws by repetition correctly. In fact: it only calls "evaluate" if maxDepth has been reached or if no legal moves are available. Therefore, if a position was repeated twice, repeating it a third time AND THEN mating still evaluates as a mate. Repeating it a third, fourth,... n-th until maxdepth is reached is correctly evaluates as a draw instead. This issue should be solved with the combination of iterative deepening (to actually evaluate all positions at incremental depths) and move ordering (to evaluate the previously found best move first. This should at some point push the draw down the list of next-best moves).
